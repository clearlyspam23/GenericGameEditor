GenericGameEditor
=================

The Generic Game Editor here (probably called JAnGLE) is an attempt at making a truly "generic" 2D game editor.

The Game Editor is designed to be easy to use, yet allow savy users to customize the system in order to create exactly the
design experience they want for their game. The system is written in java, so that it may be used readily across most platforms,
and has been designed using a plugin architecture, so that users may readily add on any features they feel necessary.
