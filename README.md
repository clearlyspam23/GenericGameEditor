JAnGLE
=================

The Generic Game Editor (JAnGLE) is an attempt at making a truly "generic" 2D game editor.

JAnGLE is designed to be easy to use, yet allow savy users to customize the system in order to create exactly the
design experience they want for their game. The system is written in java, so that it may be used readily across most platforms, and has been designed using a plugin architecture, so that users may readily add on any features they feel necessary. Long term goals for this program include supporting most possible 2d game paradigms out of the box, and hopefully support for writing simple plugins in Python as well.


This code is still very much in progress, expect breaking changes regularly.
